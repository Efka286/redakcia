In Finland, we can take you right to the heart of the pristine Lapland wilderness, staying in traditional log cabins topped with thick dollops of snow and nestled in fairytale forest. 
Exploring by snowshoe, snowmobile and husky sled, you’ll spend the night in rustic yet modern log cabins, well-equipped with open fires and saunas. 
Untainted by light pollution, the northern lights can shine brightly here – all you need to do is step outside your cabin and look up. Log cabins are a popular choice of accommodation on our excellent value, all-inclusive wilderness lodge holidays in Finland. We can also arrange for you to spend a night in an Aurora Bubble or Aurora Cabin for a spectacular ‘window on the cosmos’ – and hopefully the northern lights.
